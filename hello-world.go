The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n 2. The Docker daemon pulled this \"hello-world\" image from the GitHub Container Registry.\n    (amd64)\n 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n    to your terminal.\n\n")
