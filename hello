Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

As Docker Inc introduced rate-limiting in https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits
we simply need our own hello-world image on GitHub Container Registry.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled this "hello-world" image from the GitHub Container Registry.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
